# FreeCodeCamp Leaderboard Requirements

## Functional Spec

### User Stories

1. I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who have earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.

2. I can see how many brownie points they have earned in the past 30 days, and how many they have earned total.

3. I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they have earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.
